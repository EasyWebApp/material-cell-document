## Behaviour

Since Material only provides styles for snackbars, when coding JavaScript to interact with snackbars for particular projects,
please be aware of the following Google Material Design guidelines:

-   Only one snackbar may be displayed at a time. When a second snackbar is triggered while the first is displayed, the first should start the contraction motion downwards before the second one animates upwards.
-   Snackbars automatically disappear after a timeout or user interaction elsewhere.
-   Snackbars may contain a single action, neither of which may be “Cancel” or “Dismiss”.
-   When an unrelated dialog or popup occurs while the snackbar is up, the snackbar timeout will reset upon the window focus being regained. This is to ensure that the user will be able to read the snackbar for the full intended duration.

## Examples

### Default snackbars

<Example>
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            })
        }
    >
        SnackBar
    </Button>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { openSnackBar } from 'material-cell/source/SnackBar';
import { Button } from 'material-cell/source/Button';

render(
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            })
        }
    >
        SnackBar
    </Button>
);
```

<Example>
    <Button
        onClick={async () => {
            const emitted = await openSnackBar({
                actionText: 'Action',
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            });
            console.log('Action is emitted: ' + emitted);
        }}
    >
        SnackBar with action
    </Button>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { openSnackBar } from 'material-cell/source/SnackBar';
import { Button } from 'material-cell/source/Button';

render(
    <Button
        onClick={async () => {
            const emitted = await openSnackBar({
                actionText: 'Action',
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            });
            console.log('Action is emitted: ' + emitted);
        }}
    >
        SnackBar with action
    </Button>
);
```

### Multi-line snackbars

<Example>
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                multiple: true,
                content:
                    'When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life. –John Lennon'
            })
        }
    >
        Multi-line snackbar
    </Button>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { openSnackBar } from 'material-cell/source/SnackBar';
import { Button } from 'material-cell/source/Button';

render(
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                multiple: true,
                content:
                    'When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life. –John Lennon'
            })
        }
    >
        Multi-line snackbar
    </Button>
);
```

<Example>
    <Button
        onClick={async () => {
            const emitted = await openSnackBar({
                actionText: 'Action',
                multiple: true,
                content:
                    'When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life. –John Lennon'
            });
            console.log('Action is emitted: ' + emitted);
        }}
    >
        Multi-line with action
    </Button>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { openSnackBar } from 'material-cell/source/SnackBar';
import { Button } from 'material-cell/source/Button';

render(
    <Button
        onClick={async () => {
            const emitted = await openSnackBar({
                actionText: 'Action',
                multiple: true,
                content:
                    'When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life. –John Lennon'
            });
            console.log('Action is emitted: ' + emitted);
        }}
    >
        Multi-line with action
    </Button>
);
```

### Placement

Although all snackbars will span across the bottom of the screen on mobile devices,
they can be left or right aligned on desktop/tablet devices.

<Example>
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                align: 'left',
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            })
        }
    >
        Left-aligned snackbar
    </Button>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { openSnackBar } from 'material-cell/source/SnackBar';
import { Button } from 'material-cell/source/Button';

render(
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                align: 'left',
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            })
        }
    >
        Left-aligned snackbar
    </Button>
);
```

<Example>
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                align: 'right',
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            })
        }
    >
        Right-aligned snackbar
    </Button>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { openSnackBar } from 'material-cell/source/SnackBar';
import { Button } from 'material-cell/source/Button';

render(
    <Button
        onClick={() =>
            openSnackBar({
                align: 'right',
                content:
                    'Single line of text directly related to the operation performed'
            })
        }
    >
        Right-aligned snackbar
    </Button>
);
```
