## Indeterminate state

When indicators are indeterminate they request that the user wait while something finishes
when itâ€™s not necessary to indicate how long it will take.

Create an indeterminate linear progress by adding `indeterminate` property.

<Example>
    <Progress indeterminate />
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { Progress } from 'material-cell/source/Progress';

render(
    <Progress indeterminate />
);
```
